                <p>Gage Sampson grew up in Franklin Furnace, Ohio, a small rural community in Scioto County with a population of about 1,500.

                <p>During this period, Gage posted a random skit on TikTok that went viral &mdash; 10 million views in 24 hours and 230,000 followers in a month. Although TikTok wasn't monetizable at the time, the experience planted the seed for what would eventually become TikTok Titans. By 2024, Gage had fully transitioned from barbering into digital marketing and co-founded the agency.</p>
